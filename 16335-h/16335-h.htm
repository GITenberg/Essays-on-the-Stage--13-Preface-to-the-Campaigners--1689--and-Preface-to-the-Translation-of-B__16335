<p align = "center"><a name = "intro"><tt>Introduction</tt></a></p>

<p><tt>The three parts of D'Urfey's "The Comical History of Don
Quixote" were performed between 1694 and (probably) the end of
1696. Some of the songs included were conspicuously "smutty"--to
use a word which D'Urfey ridiculed--but the fact that the
plays were fresh in the public mind was probably the most effective
reason for Jeremy Collier's decision to include the not
very highly respected author among the still living playwrights
to be singled out for attack in "A Short View of the Immorality
and Profaneness of the English Stage", which appeared at Easter
time 1698. In July of the same year D'Urfey replied with the
preface to his "smutty" play "The Campaigners". It is this preface
which is given as the first item of the present reprint.</tt></p>

<p><tt>Pope's contemptuous prologue, written many years later and
apparently for a benefit performance of one of D'Urfey's plays, is
sufficient evidence that the playwright was not highly regarded;
but he was reputed to be a good natured man and, by the standards
of the time, his twitting of Collier--whom he accused of having
a better nose for smut than a clergyman should have--is not
conspicuously vituperative. Even his attack on the political
character of the notorious Non-Juror is bitter without being really
scurrilous. But like his betters Congreve and Vanbrugh, D'Urfey
both missed the opportunity to grapple with the real issues of
the controversy and misjudged the temper of the public. Had that
public been, as all the playwrights seem to have assumed, ready
to side with them against Collier, there might have been some
<span class = "pagenum">2</span>
justification in resting content as he and Congreve did with
the scoring of a few debater's points. But the public, even
"the town", was less interested in mere sally and rejoinder
than it was in the serious question of the relation of comedy
to morality, and hence Collier was allowed to win the victory
almost by default.</tt></p>

<p><tt>Collier's own argument was either confused or deliberately
disingenuous, since he shifts his ground several times. On occasion
he argues merely in the role of a moderate man who is
shocked by the extravagances of the playwrights, and on other
occasions as an ascetic to whom all worldly diversion, however
innocent of any obvious offence, is wicked. At one time, moreover,
he accuses the playwrights of recommending the vices which
they should satirize and at other times denies that even the
most sincere satiric intention can justify the lively representation
of wickedness. But none of his opponents actually seized
the opportunity to completely clarify the issues. Vanbrugh, it
is true, makes some real points in his "A Short Vindication of
The Relapse and The Provok'd Wife", and John Dennis, in his
heavy handed way, showed some realization of what the issues were
both in "The Usefulness of the Stage to the Happiness of Mankind,
to Government and to Religion" (1698) and, much later, In "The
Stage Defended" (1726). But, Vanbrugh is casual, Dennis is slow
witted, and it is only by comparison with the triviality of
D'Urfey or the contemptuous disingenuity of Congreve's "Amendments
of Mr. Collier's False and Imperfect Citations" (1698) that
they seem effective.</tt></p>

<span class = "pagenum">3</span>
<p><tt>At least forty books and pamphlets published between 1698
and 1725 are definitely part of the Collier controversy, but the
fact that none of them really discusses adequately fundamental
premises concerning the nature, method, and function of comedy
had serious consequences for the English stage. The situation
was further complicated by the rise of sentimental comedy and
the fact that the theories supposed to justify it were expounded
with all the completeness and clarity which were so conspicuously
lacking in the case of those who undertook halfheartedly to
defend what we call "high" or "pure", as opposed to both sentimental
and satiric comedy. Steele's epilogue to "The Lying Lover",
which versified Hobbes' comments on laughter and then rejected
laughter itself as unworthy of a refined human being, is a triumphant
epitaph inscribed over the grave of the comic spirit.</tt></p>

<p><tt>The second item included in the present reprint, namely the
anonymous preface to a translation of Bossuet's "Maxims and Reflections
Upon Plays", belongs to a different phase of the Collier
controversy. It serves as an illustration of the fact that
Collier was soon joined by men who were, somewhat more frankly
than he had himself admitted he was, open enemies of the stage
as such. He had begun with arguments supported by citations
from literary critics and he called in the support of ascetic religious
writers after his discourse was well under way. But the
direct approach by way of religion was soon taken up by others,
of whom Arthur Bedford was probably the most redoubtable as he was
certainly the most long winded, since his "Evil and Danger of
Stage Plays" (1706) crowds into its two hundred and twenty-seven
<span class = "pagenum">4</span>
pages some two thousand instances of alleged profaneness and immorality
with specific references to the texts of scripture which
condemn each one. But Bedford had not been the first to treat
the issue as one to be decoded by theologians rather than playwrights
or critics. Somewhat unwisely, perhaps, Motteux had printed
before his comedy "Beauty in Distress" a discourse "Of the Lawfulness
and Unlawfulness of Plays" (1698), written by the Italian
monk Father Caffaro, who was professor of divinity at the Sorbonne.
Unfortunately Caffaro had, some years before this English translation
appeared, already retracted his mild opinion that stage plays
were not, <i>per</i> <i>se</i>, unlawful, and it was
possible not only to cite
his retraction but also to offer the opinions of the Bishop of Meux,
who was better known to English readers than Father Caffaro. The
anonymous author of the preface to "Maxims and Reflections" grants
that dramatic poetry might, under certain circumstances, be theoretically
permissible, but rather more frankly than Collier he makes
it clear that his real intention is to urge the outlawing of the
theater itself, since all efforts to reform it are foredoomed to
failure. "But if", he writes, "the Reformation of the Stage be
no longer practicable, reason good that the incurable Evil should
be cut off". That lets the cat out of the bag.</tt></p>

<h1>PREFACE.</h1>

<p><span class= "firstletter">I</span>Must necessarily inform the
Partial, as well as Impartial Reader, that I had once design'd another
kind of Preface to my Comedy than what will appear in the following
sheets; but having in the interim been entertain'd with a Book lately
Printed, full of Abuses on all our Antient as well as Modern Poets, call'd
<span class = "sidenote">Collier, p. 196.</span>
<i>A view of the Immorality and Prophaness of the English Stage</i>; and
finding the Author, who, no doubt, extreamly values himself upon his
Talent of <i>Stage-reforming</i>, not only (to use his own Ironical
words) <i>particular in his Genius and Civilities</i>, but indecently,
unmanner'd, and scurrilous in his unjust Remarks on me, and two of my
Plays, <i>viz.</i> the first and second parts of the <i>Comical History
of</i> Don Quixote; I thought I cou'd not do better, first as a
Diversion to the Town, and next to do a little Iustice to my self, than
(instead of the other) to print a short Answer to this very Severe and
Critical Gentleman; and at the same time give him occasion to descant
upon the following Comick Papers, and my self the opportunity of
vindicating the other; with some familiar Returns (<i>en Raillere</i>)
upon his own Extraordinary <i>Integrity</i>, and Justness of the
<i>Censure</i>.</p>

<p>But first, lest I should plunge my self out of my depth, or like an
unskilful Swimmer, endanger my self by a too precipitate Rashness, let
me warily consider the Office and Habit of this unchristianlike Critick
before I Attack him: He has, or had the honour to wear the Robe of a
Clergyman of the Church of <i>England</i>: A Church, which for its
Purity, Principles, and most Incomparable Doctrines, surpasses without
objection all others in the world, which with a number of its pious,
virtuous and learned Rulers and Ministers, I admire and acknowledge with
all the faculties of my soul, heart and understanding; and on which I
never seriously reflect, but I feel a secret shame for my remissness of
duty, and my neglect, in not living hitherto up to its Admirable
Principles. This reflection would indeed have been enough to awe any one
in my circumstances from proceeding to answer his bold Censures, had I
not Courage to consider that the rest of the worthy Gentlemen of that
Robe are so good, that they will not excuse or defend our aforesaid
Critick's Injustice or Mistakes in some places, tho they are pleas'd
with his Truths in others; or be angry at me for endeavouring to gain
their good opinion, by defending my self from most of his black
Aspersions (how fair soever as yet they seem) and by unfolding him be
judg'd by their impartial reason, start a question, whither he, tho a
happy member of the aforesaid Adorable Church, does not come in for his
share of <i>Immorality</i>,
<span class = "pagenum">2</span>
and other frailties; and consequently is not as fit to be detected, by
the Wit of a Satyrical Poet; as the Poet by the positive Authority of an
Angry Malecontent, tho in the garb of an humble Churchman.</p>

<p>The <i>Vates</i>, or Poets in antient times were held in special
veneration, even their Kings, and other chief Rulers, often submitted to
the virtue of their Inspiration: Amongst which, the never enough admir'd
Mr <i>Cowley</i>, in his noble version of the <i>Davideidos</i>, gives
the <i>Royal David</i> this Title, <i>Rex olim &amp;
Vates duo Maxima munera
Coeli</i>; and numbers of others might be inserted to prove Poetical
Authority, and the respect it bore in past Ages; which, tho I have not
capacity to parallel, I hope I may be allow'd to imitate on another
subject; and in this have leave to acquit my self of several heinous
Accusations, which this Tyrannical Critick has Impos'd upon me.</p>

<p>I am not at all Ignorant of his eminent parts, Learning, and other
qualifications; nor am I insensible, as well as the rest of his Readers,
that his Book has a very fair and engaging Title-page, and is no less
Illustrated with many weighty and just censures upon the <i>Immorality of
the Stage</i>, and our licentious Writings for many years past; and tho
this has been proved by the late Ingenious Author of <i>the Vindication
of the Stage</i> to be occasion'd by the vices of the Times, and not
those of the Poets; yet thus for we can endure the Scourge, and kiss his
Rod with patience enough: And for my own part, I declare if I had found
his Severity had been moral, and had ended in the good design of
cleansing the Stage from its Impurities, and had been only a kind
Instruction to my Brethren and my self, to reform our Immoral errors, I
had, as the rest of us, with all humility imaginable, thank'd him for
his wit and good reproof; and had been so far from answering in this
manner, that I should have been proud to have my name before his Book,
with a Copy of Verses in applause of his Admirable Design. But when,
instead of this, I find he strikes at the root of our Dramatick Labours,
and the Town's diversion, for some sly and selfish ends; and instead of
reproving us with a Pastorly Mildness, Charity and Good Nature, gives us
the basest language, and with the most scurillous expression, sometimes
raging and even foaming at mouth, taxing the little liberty has always
been us'd, with <ins class = "correction"
title = "duplication in original">horrid horrid</ins>
Blasphemy, Prophaneness, and Damnable
Impiety; when Reason must inform every one we intend nothing of the
matter, besides the poor priviledge <i>Poetica Licentia</i>: and
pretending to prove this with false Quotations, unnatural Mistakes, and
Hypocritical Hypotheses, I resolv'd to controvert him, and endeavour to
prove that 'tis meerly his malice that has abus'd me and the rest,
without Reason or Provocation; and that his own Wit and Morals are not
so Infallible, but they lye also open to the censure of any Poetical
Critick, who has Courage and Sense enough to attack 'em.</p>

<p>I once more therefore address my self to the Reverend of the Gown,
from highest to the lowest, and humbly desire that they will not appear
Interested against me, because I defend myself against one that has
abus'd me, and has the honour to wear one, (to what purpose the Judgment
and Clemency of our Government knows best) I assure 'em my design is
only to turn, like the Worm that is trod upon, complain being hurt,
vindicate my self from abusive malice, and at the same time am heartily
sorry that ever I had the occasion.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">3</span>
<span class = "folionum">a2</span>
<p>
'Tis a pleasure to me however to know that I have for many years, as
well as now, the honour of the Conversation of several eminent men of
the Church; and I dare say, upon occasion, I could easily gain their
good words to prove my good behaviour. I do declare I never abus'd the
sacred order in my life, but have always had, and still have, all the
veneration for 'em that's possible; nor have any of my printed Writings
contradicted this, unless when spoken in the person of Atheists,
Libertines, and Ignorants, where 'tis natural in Comedy; nay, in my Book
of Poems you will find a <i>Satyr against Atheists</i>, and in another
Book, call'd <i>Colin's walk thro' London and Westminster</i>, a Moral
through the whole, and design'd in the honour of the Church of
<i>England</i>, to shew the stubbornness of <i>Romanists</i>, Grumblers,
and other dissenting Sects; but this my partial Antagonist never read,
nor heard of; nay, tho by his Book we may suppose he has read a
thousand, yet amongst twenty of my Comedies Acted and Printed, he never
heard of the <i>Royalist</i>, the <i>Boarding School</i>, the
<i>Marriage Hater Match'd</i>, the <i>Richmond Heiress</i>, the
<i>Virtuous Wife</i>, and others, all whose whole Plots and designs I
dare affirm, tend to that principal instance, which he proposes, and
which we allow, <i>viz.</i> the depression of Vice and encouragement of
Virtue. Not he, he has not had leisure since his last <i>holding forth
in the late Reign</i>, to do me this Justice, 'tis enough for him that
he has encounter'd <i>Don Quixot</i>:
<span class = "sidenote">Collier, <ins class = "correction" title =
"page number missing">p.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</ins></span>
And truly, I must own, was a most proper Combatant for him; for if he
had not been mad with the Wind-mill that was in his pate, or had ever
perus'd that <i>Giant</i> of an Author, upon whom I am the <i>Pigmy</i>,
as he wittily observes, he would have found the <ins class =
"correction" title = "original reads 'Bockheaded'">Blockheaded</ins>
Chaplain had been greazing his old <ins class = "correction" title =
"original reads 'Gassock'">Cassock</ins> there long before I new rigg'd
him: But that's all one, I, poor I, must be denounc'd as Criminal; I
brought him upon the Stage, I wash'd his Face, put on a new Crape Vest,
and a clean Band, which, oh, fatal accident, made him look so like
somebody, that I, in his opinion, and condemn'd by his infallibility,
have been no body ever since, <i>vox &amp; præterea nihil</i>. Well, however
this is determin'd, let me beg of my impartial Readers, to give me leave
to try what I can be, I have had good fortune I am told by others in
Lyrical Verse, which I am sure is one principal part of Poetry, I'll see
now if I can match my Antagonist in Rallying Prose. Several ingenious
Authors have already, I think, so well confuted his Assertions against
the Stage, by proofs from the Antient Poets, the Primitive Fathers, and
their Authorities, that they have far excell'd what I can pretend to do
there; only, I could have wish'd one who is best able, and whose
admirable Genius and Skill in Poetry would have been remarkably
serviceable, had drawn his Pen to defend the Rights of the Stage, tho he
had own'd the loosenesses of it, and had ventured the being presented
for it; but since we, the forlorn, are not so happy to have that Aid,
let my Antagonist, the Reformer, who, for all the gravity in some part
of his Book, and the solid Piety he would insinuate in his Arguments, I
perceive to be a Joker, and as full of Puns, Conundrums, Quibbles,
Longinquipetites, and Tipiti-witchets, as the rest of us mortals, be
pleas'd to take the length of my Weapon at that sport, for now I cannot
help telling my Audience, which is the Town, that he has laid his
reforming
<span class = "pagenum">4</span>
Cudgel upon me so severely, and it smarts so damnably, that I can't
forbear smiting again if I were to be hang'd, desiring only, as the
usual method is, a clear Stage, and from him no favour.</p>

<p>To begin then, I shall illustrate my first Scene with a comical hint
upon some part of his Character; and that the Jest may be worthy of
making you laugh, you are to know, that the first view I ever had of
this extraordinary Person, was neither better nor worse than under the
<i>Gallows</i>. Well, but think you, I warrant, 'twas about some
Charitable Duty that his sacred Function and Piety oblig'd him to, such
as Exhorting the poor Souls to confess their Crimes, in order to be
sav'd, or the like; no, faith, but quite contrary, for he was rather
hardning them, and infusing a strong Portion of his own obstinacy, to
fortifie 'em for their dubious Journey; and in few minutes after,
possess'd with a stronger Spirit of Priesthood than e'er, for some past
Ages there has been Example for, pronounc'd the <i>Absolution</i>, the
extremest and most mysterious Grace the Church can possibly give to the
most repentant Sinner, to wretches Justly condemn'd by Law to die, for
the most horrible Crimes in nature, <i>viz.</i> the intended Murder of
the King, and Subversion of the Protestant Religion and Government. Now
that such a Person should set up for a Protestant Example, and a Teacher
of Morality, is somewhat new, for upon my veracity, this Gentleman may
insinuate as he pleases, that our Church, and its Doctrines govern his
heart; but as to that matter what may be in his heart I can't tell, but
if a Pope is not crept into his belly, very near it, I am very much
mistaken.</p>

<p><i>Pliny</i> indeed, in his Natural History, <i>Lib.</i> 28,
<i>Cap.</i> 10. tells ye, He that is bitten by a Scorpion may have
relief, if immediately he go and whisper his grief into the Ear of an
Ass. This Historian, perhaps, had so great credit with these Malefactors
that they thought the remedy, by Auricular Confession, might serve too
in their Concerns. But we are confirm'd, they were enough mistaken in
the rest of their Opinions, and so 'tis very likely were in this. If
this Parallel be found a little gross, I hope the Reader will excuse it,
when he examines the bold Critick's Stile relating to the Poets.
Besides, how wise soever he may be in other things, I'm sure all those
that are so, and true Sons of the Church, when they reflect on that
Action of his, will own that he deserves that, or a worse Title. And so
to proceed.</p>

<p>But before we inspect further, or touch upon the Moralist's
Immorality, for I dare ingage it is not altogether impossible to prove,
the <i>Pulpiteer</i> may be tainted a little as well as the
<i>Poetaster</i>, let us see whether we can find him guilty of the first
Charge against us, which is <i>Immodesty</i>; and upon this subject
indeed, if our Learn'd Reformer did not impose upon us with a Fallacy, I
should (to shew my good Nature walk hand in hand with my resentment)
once more admire him for his Character of Modesty in the 11th page of
his Book, which is, to do him Justice, very fine; but then he only tells
us of one kind of Modesty, when he knows there are two, and therein he
is Falacious, in not exposing the other, which is decency of Speech and
Behaviour; and truly, meerly, I believe, through a conscious reflection
of his own frequent miscarriages in that case. If therefore, these
Papers differ a little from that Civility which is proper, I beg the
Readers pardon, and assure him 'tis only in
<span class = "pagenum">5</span>
imitation of his Stile to me, as all those that read his Book may
find.</p>

<p>
For, in the first place, he does not shew his own, nor, indeed, any part
of decent modesty, in exposing any Gentlemans Name in print, when the
subject matter is Satyr, Reflection, Scandal, &amp;<i>c.</i> and in
which case I believe the Law might do Justice, if apply'd to; but if
not, I am sure good Manners, and civil Education, ought to tie the
Cassock as close as the Sash or Sursingle; but this our Divine helper,
most Bully-like, disallows; for he, puff'd with his Priestly Authority,
calls us boldly to the Bar of his Injustice by our own Names, the same
minute that he is roaringly accusing us of Blasphemy, Smuttery, Foolery,
and a thousand Monstrosities besides, as he'd make you believe; unless
for variety, he picks out one amongst the rest, now and then, to abuse a
little more civilly, and then, rubbing up his old College Wit, he
Nicknames 'em, as you may find elegantly made out at
the latter end of his Book,
(for he shall see that I have read it quite through, and can hop over
pages as fast as he for the life of him) where he can find no other Name
or Character for two Gentlemen of Honour and Merit, <i>viz.</i> Mr.
<i>Congreve</i> and Captain <i>Vanbrooke</i>, who have written several
excellent Plays, and who are only scandalous to our Critick, by being
good Poets, yet these he can give no other Names or Characters, but what
are Abusive and Ridiculous.
<span class = "sidenote">Collier, <i>p.</i> 74.</span>
The first, for only making <i>Jeremy</i>, in <i>Love for Love</i>, call
the Natural inclinations to eating and drinking, <i>Whorson
Appetites</i>, he tells, That the <i>Manicheans, who made Creation the
Work of the Devil, scarcely spoke any thing so course</i>. And then very
modestly proceeding onwards says, <i>The Poet was </i>Jeremy<i>'s
Tutor</i>. The t'other Gentleman he dignifies by a new Coin'd name of
his own, <i>viz.</i> <i>The Relapser</i>, and much like an humble Son of
the Church, a Man of Morals and Manners tells us, <i>This Poet is fit to
Ride a Match with Witches:</i>
<span class = "sidenote">Collier, <i>p.</i> 230.</span>
<i>And, that </i>Juliana Cox<i> </i>(a Non-juring Hag, I suppose, of his
Acquaintance)<i> never switch'd a Broom-stick with more expedition.</i>
Faith, such sentences as these, may be taking enough amongst his Party;
but if this be his way of Reproving the Stage, and Teaching the Town
Modesty, he will have fewer Pupils, I believe, than he
imagines.</p>

<p>
But to do that Gentleman Broom-stick Rider some Justice, and because we
shall want a Name hereafter to Christen the t'other, as he has given the
Name of <i>Relapser</i>, so I think that of the <i>Absolver</i> will be
a very proper one to distinguish our Switcher, by which the Reader may
observe, that we are civiller to him than he to us however. And first
then, I desire all Persons to observe, that in other places of the same
Chapter of his Book, our <i>Absolver</i>, for all his detestation of the
Stage, and of Poetry in general, yet takes a huge deal of pains in
taking to pieces, and mending the Comedy of the <i>Relapse</i>; nay, and
to shew how transcendent his own Skill in these things is, he has help'd
the Author to a better Name for his Play, and says,
<span class = "sidenote">Collier, <i>p.</i> 210.</span>
<i>The Younger Brother</i>, or, <i>The Fortunate Cheat</i>, had been
much properer. This shews some good will he has to the Comick Trade
however; and I doubt not, but if his Closet were Ransack'd, we might
find a divertive Scene or two, effects of his idle Non-preaching hours,
where Modesty, Wit, and good Behaviour, would be shewn in
perfection.<p>

<span class = "pagenum">6</span>
<p>And yet, as to his own humour, we find it to be, by his Book, more
fickle than even the Wind, or Feminine frailty in its highest
Inconstancy. One while he's for Instructing our Stage, Modelling our
Plays, Correcting the Drama, the Unity, Time and Place, and acts as very
a Poet as ever writ an ill Play, or slept at an ill Sermon; and then,
presently after, wheiw, in the twinkling of an
<ins class = "correction" title =
"original reads 'Ejaculution', Congreve has 'ejaculation'">Ejaculation</ins>,
as Parson <i>Say-grace</i> has it, he's summoning together a Convocation
of old Fathers, to prove the Stage in past Ages exploded, and all Plays
horrible, abominable Debauchers of youth, and not to be encourag'd in a
Civil Government. What can we think of this, especialiy when I find him
in this Paragraph of his Book<ins class = "correction"
title = "asterisk in original"> * </ins>raving on at this rate,
and quoting to us, That
St. <i>Cyprian</i>, or the Author <i>de Spectaculis</i>, argues thus
against those who thought the Play-House no unlawful diversion; 'tis too
tedious to recite all, but enough of St. <i>Cyprian</i> for my purpose
runs thus: <i>What business has a Christian at such Places as these? A
Christian who has not the liberty so much as to think of an ill thing,
why does he entertain himself with lewd Representations? Has he a mind
to discharge his Modesty, and be flesh'd for the Practice? Yes, this is
the consequence, by using to see these things, he'll learn to do them;
what need I mention the Levities and Impertinencies in Comedies, or the
Ranting distractions of Tragedy, were these things unconcern'd with
Idolatry, Christians ought not to be at them, for were they not highly
Criminal, the foolery of them is Egregious, and unbecoming the gravity
of Believers.</i> And then again, before he is out of breath, <i>A
Christian has much better Sights than these to look at, he has solid
Satisfactions in his power, which will please and improve him at the
same time. Would a Christian be agreeably refresh'd, let him read the
Scriptures, here the Entertainment will suit his Character, and be big
enough for his quality. Ah, Beloved, how noble, how moving, how
profitable a thing is it, to be thus employ'd, to have our expectations
always in prospect, and be intent on the glories of Heaven!</i> Very
good, and who is he so reprobated, that will not allow this to be
devout, and admirable good Counsel? But now let us see how the
<i>Absolver</i>, for all Pious quotation, has follow'd St.
<i>Cyprian</i>'s Advice; that holy Father charges him not to entertain
himself with such lewd things as Plays, and he very dutifully reads a
thousand as fast as he can; nay, scans and weighs 'em, and, no doubt,
not without tickling satisfaction, at the present, for all his Saturnine
Remarks at last. Now if his Answer to this is, That it belongs to his
Office, as a Church-man, and that he could not reprehend the Vices in
'em without reading the Books themselves, I must tell him, That St.
<i>Cyprian</i>, nor the rest of the Fathers, did not allow that, neither
do we find they did it themselves, for all their inveighing against the
Stage; so that he makes his own Quotation altogether invalid, <i>He not
being to do ill that good might come of it.</i></p>

<p>And therefore, why may not a Poet now, who, perhaps, is a greater
Votary to St. <i>Cyprian</i> in other Matters than the <i>Absolver</i>
is in this, rally him thus, and turn his Quotation upon himself, Phrase
by Phrase? "What business has a Parson with such Books as these? A
Parson who has not the liberty so much as to think of an ill thing? Why
does he entertain himself with lewd Comedies? Has he a mind to discharge
his Priestcraft, and flesh himself up for a Poet? Yes, this is the
consequence, by using to see these <i>smutty</i> things, he'll learn to
write 'em.
<span class = "pagenum">7</span>
What need I mention the Sham-Oaths, and looseness of Farce, or the
Fustian raving against the Gods in Tragedy, were these things really
unconcern'd with Idolatry, a Parson, of all Mankind, should not be known
to ogle them, for were they not highly Criminal, the foolery of them is
Egregious, and unbecoming the gravity of all that thump the Cushion, or
intend to thump a true Belief into the Pates of an incorrigible
Congregation."</p>

<p>And now methinks I see the Spiritual Critick, with a certain sallow
Male-contented Phiz, poring upon this Page, and sucking his Ring-finger,
gives himself an unpleasurable minute to Judge whether I have
paraphras'd right or no; well, all's one, fall back fall edge, I'm
resolv'd to bait him with St. <i>Cyprian</i> a little more. "A Parson
has, or should have, much better Books than Plays to look in; he has
many Authors of Pious and Solid Authorities to please, and improve
himself with, at the same time. Would a Parson be agreeably refresh'd,
let him read the Scriptures, let him find out Treatises of Morality,
Meekness, Charity, and holy Life, there the Entertainment will suit his
Character. Ah, Beloved, how noble, how moving, how profitable a pleasure
would it be to us, to see a Parson thus employ'd, to let the Stage's
diversions be too little for his grave Consideration, and be intent
himself on the glories of Heaven!" And here now, I do not at all
question but the <i>Absolver</i>, a little nettled at this last
Parallel, will fall to biting of his fingers again, his Righteous Spirit
being offended at my Insolence, in scribling the Word <i>Parson</i> so
oft, it being a Nickname, and only invented by some idle fellow, who
resolv'd to use the Order with no more respect. Why truly, I confess, in
this Case, Modesty is a little gravell'd, but then she may thank him for
it, for he has dignify'd the Poets with so many <i>Hell-defying</i>,
<i>deep-mouth'd Swearing</i>, <i>Relapsing</i>, <i>Witch-riding
Titles</i>, that the worthy Ministry cannot reasonably be angry,
especially when the Word is only meant to him, whom I shall prove has
lessen'd the true Title, by his <i>Immorality</i> and
<i>Hypocrisie</i>, more than ever the Poets did the Reputation of the
Stage, by their Time-serving Loosenesses and Licentious
Diversions.</p>

<p>It is, no doubt, a considerable Maim to us, in some Peoples opinions,
who never digested the benefits arising from the Stage in its Moral
Representations, that this smarting Lash is given us by a Clergy-man of
the Church of <i>England</i>, that is, good friends, if he be so, for
some Judicious Heads are not resolv'd in that Affirmative&mdash;but let
that be <i>discuss'd</i> in another place, I'm sure, if he is,
<i>Obedience to Government, in the first place, should be his principal
Tenet</i>; and whether that is a part of the <i>Absolver</i>'s
Character, I think has sufficiently appear'd. But let him be what he
will, I shall now take the pleasure to inform those People, that but few
years since, we had a Man of Wit and Learning, that wore the Gown, and
as true a Son of the Church as she could possibly breed; that was
intirely devoted a Champion in our Cause, and Asserted the Rights of the
Stage with Success and Applause; and whoever will but look back a
little, and incline his Eyes towards the delectable River <i>Cam</i>,
may Encounter the fam'd Wit of that University, the Ingenious Mr.
<i>Thomas Randolph</i>, who in one of his great many admirable Pieces,
call'd the <i>Muses Looking-glass</i>, makes his whole Moral to be the
Vindication
<span class = "pagenum">8</span>
of the Stage, and its usefulness, and by shewing the passions in their
Kinds, <ins class = "correction"
title = "original reads 'coutrives'">contrives</ins>
to confute some canting prejudic'd Zealots,
whose ignorance and frenzy had conspir'd before to run it down; I will
treat the Reader here with some of it.</p>

<p>Here was a pretty Compliment to our Art now, a good Moral with good
Manners into the bargain; and yet 'tis certain the times then were as
Licentious as now, and the Poets took as little care of their Writings;
but Mr <i>Randolph</i> always made his good Nature agree with his Wit,
and put as favourable construction upon Scenes of Diversion, as reason
would allow, tho he perhaps had as much occasion for 50 <i>l.</i> as the
Absolver when he writ his Book. He knew that if there was so stupid a
Temper, that the Moral of a Play could not reform, the looseness that
was in it could not prejudice; nor if a wild Town-Fellow, or a baffl'd
Bully, or passionate Lover, being characters in a Play, spoke some
extravagances proper for 'em, would he roar it out for <ins class =
"correction" title = "original reads 'Balsphemy'">Blasphemy</ins>,
Profaneness, &amp;<i>c.</i> and make a malicious scrutiny, and unreasonable
interpretation of words, which had no other intention but to make the
Character natural by customary manner of Speech, as he has shewn
examples by two of his own, in the extremes of Vain-glory and
Hypocrisie: And yet this Gentleman was as Learned, as good a Critick,
and as Consciencious a man, as our Absolver can pretend to be; and if I
say, I had somewhat a better Title to Modesty and good Manners, I think
it may be made out, he having a civil regard to the Poets, defended
their Cause, and excus'd some failings for the sake of some other
Merits, when this treats 'em all like fools, tho he has only rak'd up a
few of their errors, which he has made a huge heap of Rubbish, by
peering through his own Magnifying Glass, without any allowance to their
qualifications, or any modest care to do 'em justice, which ought to
have been one way as well as another.</p>

<p>So much then for his <i>Modesty</i> in one of its kinds, which is
decency of behaviour and expression; as for the other, he has plaid such
a Game at Hide and Seek with us, that we have been long in a Mist, not
knowing how to discover it: But the Air clears, and 'tis time for us now
to take the right end of the perspective, tho he would give
us
<span class = "pagenum">9</span>
<span class = "folionum">b</span>
the Wrong, and then try if we cannot discern, in the midst of his Garden
of Divinity, a neat friend of his call'd Immorality, tho he would subtly
insinuate him into the world as a stranger, leading his darling daughter
dear Hypocrisie into an Arbor; where, after they had been some time
alone, our Critick knowing how to be civil to his own creature, and to
give 'em time enough to beget a right understanding, he is very glad at
last to be a third in the company.</p>

<p>I should not have put him upon this warm Office, if I had not found
him too hot and bold with our Famous Ancient Truth-telling Poet
<i>Juvenal</i>, when in his Book he tells us,
<span class = "sidenote">Collier, p. 70, 71.</span>
<i>he teaches those vices he would correct, and writes more like a Pimp
than a Poet</i>&mdash;But upon just consideration, I believe if the
Absolver taught the Art of Rebellion no more than <i>Juvenal</i> the Art
of Pimping, the one would be respected in after Ages, as much as we know
the other has in the former: But every one is Fool or Knave that is not
of this Gentlemans kidney. A little while after, at the usual rate of
his own accustom'd civility, he falls upon the <i>Renown'd
Shakespear</i>, and says,
<span class = "sidenote">Collier, p. 50.</span>
he is so guilty, that he is not fit to make an Evidence. Why now it
'twere possible for his Complexion to blush, there's ne're a Robe of any
Friend Cardinal the Absolver has at <i>Rome</i>, that can be redder than
his would be for such a Position: Nor does it end here, but is mixt with
some more foolish and insolent Remarks in another place, upon the
admirable Tragedy of <i>Hamlet</i>. And here he has no other way to shew
his malice, but by ridiculously quibbling upon the prettiest Character
in it,
<span class = "sidenote">Collier, p. 10.</span>
the innocent young Virgin <i>Ophelia</i>, who, because the Poet makes
her run mad for the death of her Father, and loss of her Lover, and
consequently makes her sing and speak some idle extravagant things, as
on such an occasion is natural, and at last drown her self, he very
masterly tells us, the Poet, <i>since he was resolv'd to drown her like
a Kitten, should have set her a swimming a little sooner; to keep her
alive, only to sully her Reputation, is very cruel</i>. Yes, but I would
fain ask Doctor Absolution in what she has sullied her Reputation, I am
sure five hundred Audiences that have view'd her could never find it
out, tho he has; but the Absolver can't help being positive and partial
to his own humour, tho he were to be hang'd, as the Lady was drown'd,
for he is very angry in another place with the aforesaid Author, for
making
<span class = "sidenote">Collier, p. 125.</span>
<i>Sir </i>Hugh Evens<i> in the Merry Wives of Windsor</i>, a silly,
eating, chattering <i>Welch</i> Priest, but vindicates and speaks well,
of <i>Sir </i>John<i>, Parson of </i>Wrotham<i>, in the History of Sir
</i>John Oldcastle; tho he swears, games, wenches, pads, tilts and
drinks, and does things which our Reformers Guts are ready to come up at
another time, only, forsooth, because he is stout; but 'tis indeed only
<i>because he is a Parson</i>, and sullen, which he thinks wise, for he
cannot endure that Copyhold should be touch'd, as you may see more
plainly a little further, where he says in <i>Loves Labour Lost</i>, the
Curate plays the fool egregiously; and so does the Poet too: there he
clenches the Nail, there he gives <i>Shakespear</i> a bold stroke, there
obstinacy and malice appear in true colours: And yet if a parcel of the
ones Plays, were set up by way of Auction against t'others <i>Sermons
and Essays</i>; nay, tho the Loyal and Politick <i>Desertion
discussd</i> was thrown in to boot, I know not what the Grave would do,
but I am sure the Wise would quickly find difference. And yet
to
<span class = "pagenum">10</span>
Remark him nicely, this humour of railing is only where the Poets do not
suit with his design; for in another place you'll find this same
<i>Shakespear</i>, that was before too guilty to make an Evidence, a
very civil person now; for the Reformer is troubl'd with Fits, you must
know, disturbances i th' brain, which makes him forget one hour what he
rails at another, for here now
<span class = "sidenote"><ins class = "correction" title =
"text missing">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</ins>54</span>
<i>Shakespear</i>'s <i>Falstaff</i> is call'd the admir'd, because he is
to serve his turn. And that the Poet <i>was not so partial as to let his
humour compound for his lewdness</i>; but punishes him at last, tho he
makes him all his life time a damnable, <i>smutty</i> fellow. And now, I
think, having said enough of his modest behaviour, 'twon't be amiss to
have a touch or two at his Hypocrisy. And first, concerning the word
Smutt.</p>

<p>"Smutt, Smutt"! Why does this tarmagant Correcter of our Lives and
Manners pretend to make us believe that his Mouth or Conscience is so
streight, that the t'other word can't get passage, or did his Mistress
(honourable I mean) sit knotting under his Nose when he was writing, and
so gave occasion for the changing it instead of Bawdy, that that odious
word might not offend her, tho the Phrase was made Nonsence by
it&mdash;hum&mdash;No faith, the case seems to me now to be quite
otherwise, and really the effect of downright <i>Hypocrisy</i>, unless
done as I said for the last reason; for those that have read his Book,
may find sprinkling up and down the other words extreamly plain upon
occasion, <i>Ribaldry</i> and <i>Bawdy</i>, and <i>Whores</i>, and
<i>Whoring</i>, and <i>Strumpets</i>, and <i>Cuckoldmakers</i>, with as
fat a signification as any of the last nam'd could wish for their
hearts; for example, by way of Tract, first, he says,
<span class = "sidenote">Collier, p. 30, 32.</span>
<i>Euripides</i> in his <i>Hipolitus</i>, calls <i>Whoring</i>
stupidness and playing the fool; and secondly, does <i>Ribaldry</i>,
(not Smut) and Nonsence become the dignity of their station.
Again,
<span class = "sidenote">p. 74.</span>
<i>Berinthia</i> incourages <i>Amanda</i> to play the <i>Whore</i>; and
then sowse upon <i>Don Quixot</i>, when there is not so much as one
little tiny todpol of <i>Smut</i>, that I know of, unless he creates
it&mdash;Yet I am Crambo'd with,
<span class = "sidenote">p. 208.<br>
p. 178.</span>
<i>who, with low, nauseous Bawdry fills his Plays</i>. Again speaking of
<i>Jupiter</i> and <i><ins class = "correction"
title = "original reads 'Aclmena'">Alcmena</ins></i>&mdash;but her
Lover&mdash;<i>that is her Whore-master</i>. And at last with a
Rowzer upon Mr <i>Congreeve</i>'s <i>Double Dealer</i>, where he
particularly Remarks,
<span class = "sidenote">p. 12.</span>
<i>that there are but four Ladies in his Play, and three of em are
Whores</i>; adding, withal, that 'tis <i>a great Compliment to Quality,
to tell em there is but a quarter of 'em honest</i>. Why who, in the
name of <i>Diana</i>, and all the rest of the Maiden <i>Goddesses</i>,
does tell 'em so, unless it be Doctor <i>Crambo</i> here&mdash;If any
one calls
'em <i>Whores</i> 'tis he, he that by an assum'd Authority thinks he may
say any thing; the Ladies, I dare say for the Poet, were drest in such
clean Linnen, and were so far from being Tawdry, that no Scrutineer but
our severe Master of Art but wou'd have thought Charitably of 'em. Well,
but huge Rampant <i>Whores</i> they must be with him tho, and through
that very mouth that simper'd and primm'd before, as if such a filthy
word cou'd not possibly break through: It comes out now in sound and
emphasis, and the modest Pen is as prone and ready to write it. So that
I once more affirm, that if it were not done in respect to his Lady,
who, no doubt, peruses him extreamly, it must naturally be the effect of
<i>Hypcrisie</i>, for, to be squeamish in one place and not in another
is Ridiculous, especially when one word is Innocent in its kind, and
makes the sense, and the other when us'd makes it wretched Affectation,
and almost Nonsence.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">11</span>
<span class = "folionum">b2</span>
<p>Now if the <i>Absolver</i> thought Affectation would appear a vertue
in him, he ought to have squeamifyed the before-mention'd Ladies with
some title that was new, and if <i>Smutt</i> was chosen to be his fine
darling word (and the course one of <i>Whores</i> slipt out of his
Mouth, or from his Pen, by misfortune or chance) he should, in my
opinion, have given 'em the title of <i>Smutters</i>: a primming neat
word extremely proper for the occasion: And I hope I shall live to see
the Master of Art have Modesty enough to thank me for't; or else (for my
fancy wou'd fain oblige him if it cou'd) to make it yet more
<i>German</i> to the matter, as <i>Shakespear</i> has it, to call em
<i>Colliers</i> would be as significant as any thing; for there's
allusion enough to <i>Smutt</i>, or the Devil's in't: For, to deal
sincerely, and without <i>Hypocrisie</i>, I cannot imagine what this
learned Gentleman can mean by all that Smutt, Smutt, when the other word
is as decent and more significant, unless he banters, or dissembles, or
fear'd the Ladies peeping, or is so full of his own name, that he goes
along quibbling upon't through his Book, with design that way to make
himself more famous.</p>

<p>In another part of his Treatise too I fancy I find the
<i>Hypocrite</i> a great deal more than the <i>Moralist</i>, and that
is, in his kecking at a word in one place, and gobbling it up in
another. To prove this, I find him very like a Ghostly Father of the old
<i>Roman</i> Kidney, condemning even to the Inquisition: One
<i>Carlos</i> in Mr <i>Dryden</i>'s <i>Love Triumphant</i>, for
blundring out this <i>horrible Expression</i>, as he calls
it,
<span class = "sidenote">Collier, p. 82.</span>
<i>Nature has given me my portion of Sense, with a Pox to her</i>. Now
pray observe, the <i>Absolvers</i> Stomach is so horribly squeamish, at
this he belches, turns pale, and is so very sick, that a quartern of
Cherry is administered in vain, to set him to rights; he prints instead
of the word only a great P&mdash;&mdash; and tells the gentle Reader,
(that he is intending to lead by the Nose) that the <i>Hellish
syllable</i> may be found there at length if he pleases. Would not any
one think now, that did not know that the Small Pox is a common Disease,
that this word had been <i>Blasphemy</i> in the extremity, the
renouncing the Deity, or something beyond pardon, and would not one lay
a Scholars Egg against a Tost and Ale, that the Doctor would ne're be
concern'd with it as long as he was able to eat or drink either of 'em.
Why see now how an honest man may be cheated; do but turn to the one
hundred seventy second page of his Book, and you will find this
horrible, this hellish, syllable, in its Pontificallibus, at length,
sitting almost a straddle upon the top of the Page, and
<span class = "sidenote">Collier, p. 172.</span>
us'd familiarly and friendly, without so much as once kacking at it, or
one invective near it, tho the sense of the Curse is as broad as
t'other, and has rather the worse signification.</p>

<p>And pray what can this be else but Hypocrisy; if the word were really
terrifying and horrible to him, it would certainly be so in one place as
well as another. No, no, these are only flights and amusements, tricks
of his own studied Legerdemain, to make the bubbled ignorants believe
him a Saint, and admire his Divinity, when, if they could dive to the
bottom of the secret, 'tis solemnly believ'd by many of the dutiful Sons
of the Church, that our Sham-reformer is a much fitter man to win Money
by his skill at a game of Whisk and Swabbers, than as the case of
Allegiance, and Morality, stand with
<span class = "pagenum">12</span>
him, to win Souls from Reprobation by the Integrity of his
Principles.</p>

<p>I must treat ye with one instance more of his <i>Hypocrisie</i>, and
then I pass on to another Head. This instance I find Mr <i>Vanbrook</i>
has taken particular notice of at the latter end of his Book, where,
'tis true, every one may see the <i>Absolvers</i> Foible is very plain,
but that Author has not made the Case parallel with the others Remark
upon <i>Mr.Congreve</i>'s Comedy the <i>Old Batchelor</i>, which shews
his contradiction of himself, and his fallacy undeniable,
<span class = "sidenote">Collier, p. 63.</span>
for there he seems to roar at young <i>Belmour</i> for his forgetfulness
of Religion, at a minute when he is desiring <i>Letitia to give him
leave to swear by her Lips and Eyes</i>, when he is kissing and telling
her, <i>Eternity was in that moment</i>. In short, when he has got her
fast in his Arms, and intends to go through stitch with the matter; for
which he calls the Lady Strumpet, and raves at the smuttiness of the
Action; and yet, a little while after, in another page, rallies, jokes
upon, and banters young <i>Worthy</i> in the <i>Relapse</i>, for letting
his Lady slip through his fingers, and
<span class = "sidenote">Collier, p. 127.</span>
calls him a <i>Town-Spark</i>, and a <i>Platonick Fool</i> for't. Hey
Jingo, here's Riddling for ye! what would this whimsical Gentleman be
at? first he rails at a Lover for holding a pretty Woman fast, and then
he jokes upon him for letting her go; this runs almost parallel with the
Fable of the Satyr and the Traveller; but if the Doctor is observ'd to
have the faculty of blowing hot and cold thus, I believe he may keep his
breath either to cool his Porridge, or to warm his fingers, and be much
better employ'd, than by using it to make any Proselytes to his
Doctrine; and so much for this Head. Now let us try if we can scratch
another, and find it out under his Night-cap of</p>


<h2>IMMORALITY.</h2>

<p>It is not enough to prove a Man is a Moralist, only because he is
noted for a Regular Life; that may be one good instance indeed; but it
can never arrive to a proof of the whole, for his living Soberly, and by
Rule, may as well be caus'd by the defect of his Constitution, as by the
effect of his Inclination, but 'tis the Spirit and Will, by the fire of
whose other Virtues, this of Morality is kindled and illustrated. Now I
will not be so byass'd by other Peoples opinions that know him, to say,
That our devout Critick owes him seeming Piety, and good life, to his
ill habit of Body; nor will I load him with Abuse, <i>right or wrong, as
he has done me, particularly through a whole Chapter</i>, but leave that
charitably to natural Conscience, or studied Artifice, which he pleases,
and only reflect a little on the temper of his Mind, as I have found it
blazing in this last, as well as others of his Books. In the first
place, if Stubbornness, which causes wrong opinion of the present Regal
Authority and Government, is an Immoral Vice, if he is not tainted, I
know not who is; for let any one, who is not blinded with Partiality,
but read his <i>Desertion Discuss'd</i>, with the admirable Answer to
it, and I am satisfied he cannot help joining with me in this opinion,
That what he would insinuate to be the effect of Right in others, and of
Conscience in himself, is nothing but the effect of Error in one, and
Obstinacy and Stubborn
<span class = "pagenum">13</span>
Will in t'other, a humour resolv'd to defend and carry on a hot
Argument, tho it has been never so plain and reasonably confuted: the
Positions and Answers on this subject I shall not insert here, but leave
the Reader, whose curiosity obliges him, to the Papers themselves, only
I wish the <i>Absolver</i> had made <i>Newgate</i> the last Scene of
that part of his <i>Immorality</i>, and by an humble acknowledgment to
his Patron that redeemed him, (I hope the word will bear in this place)
have spar'd his Office of <i>Absolution</i> in another Scene, and
consequently given no occasion to believe that his disobedient humour,
and turbulent nature, still proceeds daily, to cultivate his Party with
the same Principles as far as he can.</p>

<p>Another spice of <i>Immorality</i> I believe I can make appear by his
Pride, and tho' in other places it is to be found, yet is most fairly
instanc'd in his <i>Book of Essays</i>, where, tho' we find one Chapter
wholly upon that Vice, which, to shew his Justice, begins with a
Compliment upon the same <i>Juvenal</i>, now he has use for him whom he
call'd Pimp before, yet it has not bulk enough to Skreen from us his
haughtiness in another, which he calls the <i>Office of a Chaplain</i>,
for there you shall find he has collected the Spirit of them all, and
blended them into one Character; I mean the ill Spirits of the ill
<i>Chaplains</i>, <i>those that are good I honour</i>. Here you may find
his Likeness in <i>Don Quixot</i>, <i>Roger</i> in the <i>Scornful
Lady</i>, <i>Bull</i> in the <i>Relapse</i>, <i>Say-grace</i>,
<i>Cuff-cushion</i>, and others, all learning their Lessons of their
stubborn Superior our Reformer, and all tending to governing,
brow-beating, snubbing, commanding Families, and the like, but not one
word of <i>humility</i> tack'd to't, for fear of spoiling the Character;
there you may find 24 pages, one after another, all written to prove
most gloriously, that 'tis impossible for a <i>Chaplain</i> to be a
Servant; that tho' you find a poor fellow in a tatter'd Excommunicated
Gown with one sleeve, Shoes without heels, miserable Antichristian
breeches, with some two dozen of creepers brooding in the seams; and
tho' you take him charitably to your House, feed, clothe, and give him
wages, yet he belongs only <i>to God</i>, and not you, and you must not
think him your <i>Domestick</i>, but your <i>Superior</i>. Why, what a
Scheme is here laid for Vanity and Folly, add how much more shining and
beautiful does gratitude and humility appear in such a Depender, than
such a bloated opinion as this? Would any honest Gentleman, that has his
sences, shew his Indulgence and Generosity to Wit or Learning, on such
terms as these? And does not this Chapter shew more the Spirit of Pride
in our <i>Absolver</i>, relating to his own humour, than the veneration
he has for the Clergy, or the Justice he would seem to do them in it? I
dare affirm, most of them are against this Opinion, at least I'm sure
all the modest part are, who cannot but own themselves subservient to
their Patrons that maintain them, tho' at the same time they are
Ministers of <i>Gods holy Words and Sacraments</i>. Yet he <ins class =
"correction" title = "possible error for 'busily'">buffly</ins> goes
on,
<span class = "sidenote"><i>Office of a Chaplain</i>, p.
178.<br>
<br>
Ib. <i>p.</i> 185.</span>
<i>He is Gods Minister, not Mans Servant</i>. And a little way further,
he clenches this admirable Notion through and through; therefore, says
he,
<i>for a Patron to acconnt such a Consecrated Person, as if he belong'd
to him as a Servant, is in effect to challenge Divine Honours, and set
himself up for a God</i>. Here's Ambition, here's Perfection, here's old
<i>Bonner</i> for ye. Now by his <i>Hollidame</i>, for I can't forbear
that Oath now, what can a squeamish Critick,
<span class = "pagenum">14</span>
that would make <i>Remarks</i> upon the <i>Remarker</i> call this? But
stay, he's at it again,
<span class = "sidenote">Collier, <i>p.</i> 113.</span>
<i>Dolopion</i>, says he, <i>was Priest to </i>Scamander<i>, and
regarded like the God he belong'd to</i>. Pray mind him, the Priest was
worshipp'd equal with the God&mdash;oh rare Moralist&mdash;if he were,
'twas an <i>Ægyptian</i> Worship, where only <i>Calves</i> and
<i>Apes</i>, and <i>Carrots</i> and <i>Onions</i>, were <i>Gods</i>. But
pray let us see a little, has not this Divine quotation a tang of
<i>Blasphemy</i> in't? Oh fie, no; what, the <i>Moralist</i>!
<i>Reformer</i> of <i>Vices</i>! Speak <i>Blasphemy</i>! Impossible! he
can't sure! Yes, yes, he may, when he thinks no body can find him out:
and faith, to my sence now, this smells as rank of <i>Pandemonium</i>,
of fire and brimstone, to the full, if not worse, than Mr.
<i>Dryden</i>'s Verse,
<span class = "sidenote">Absalom <i>and</i> Achit.<br>
<br>
Collier <i>p.</i> 184.</span>
<i>Whether inspir'd with a Diviner Lust his father got him</i>, &amp;c.
which is spoken only in the figurative Person of <i>David</i>; yet he
says 'tis <i>downright defiance of the Living God, and the very Essence
and Spirit of Blasphemy</i>. And here now his Stomach wambled more
terribly than before; so that if his Friend were by, he must of
necessity hold the Bason. Oh me! he reaches and reaches, and first up
comes&mdash;egh&mdash;<i>I question whether</i>&mdash;egh&mdash;<i>the
torments and despair of the Damn'd</i>&mdash;egh&mdash;<i>dare venture
at such flights as these</i>. And now the Head being held by the same
hand, at two reaches more it comes all up, mix'd with a Tincture of old
<i>Bonner</i> again&mdash;egh&mdash;<i>I can't forbear saying, that the
next bad thing to writing these Impieties</i>&mdash;egh&mdash;<i>is to
suffer them</i>. And now the Fit's over, leaving us to imagine what rare
Church Discipline we should have, if this Gentleman, and his Cat with
nine Tails, were in Power; I think a Couplet or two here, by way of
Advice to him, is not improper.

<p>Now if he be Moral enough to take old <i>Chaucer</i>'s Advice I shall
be glad; and so much for that subject. There is nothing now remains,
before I come to vindicate <i>Don Quixot</i>, but a large Remark of his,
upon the little or no swearing in Plays, which commonly is only a kind
of an Interjection, as gad, I cod, oonz, &amp;<i>c.</i> which I don't
defend neither, and if any others have carelesly past the Press I'm
sorry for't, for I hate them as much as he, yet because the Doctor has
quoted the Statute Law against it and Players, to slander on one side,
tho to reform on t'other, I will in return quote another piece of Law
relating to Oaths, extreamly for his advantage, for there is only this
quibbling difference between us, 'Tis a fault in us in swearing when we
should not, and in him for not swearing when he should; but that now he
may have occasion to say my Civilities are particular to him, I will
make him do't.</p>

<p><i>I </i>J.C.<i> do sincerely promise and swear, that I will be
faithful, and bear true Allegiance to His Majesty King </i>William<i>:
And I do swear that I do, from my heart, abhor, detest and abjure, as
Impious and Heretical, that damnable Doctrine and Position, that Princes
excommunicated, or depriv'd by the Pope, or any Authority of the See of
</i>Rome<i>, may be Depos'd or Murther'd by their Subjects, or any other
whatsoever.</i></p>

<p><i>And I do declare that no Foreign Prince, Person, Prelate, State or
Potentate, hath, or aught to have, any Jurisdiction, Power, Superiority,
Preeminence or Authority, Ecclesiastical or Spiritual, within this
Realm.</i> So help me God.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">16</span>
<p>This now, with a sincerity proper, and coming to Church to hear our
Divine Service, with the <i>Prayer</i> for the <i>King</i> in't, would
give one a little satisfaction as to the Doctors present opinion, for
what he has been, if you will but examine and scan it by his Book, tho
it be a Reforming Book, is I am sure very disputable; in one Page of it
he seems very zealous for the Protestant Reformation, and
says,
<span class = "sidenote">Collier, p. 108.</span>
being very much piqu'd at <i>Sir John Brute</i>'s putting on a
Clergy-man's Habit in the <i>Provok'd Wife</i>, <i>that the Church of
</i>England<i>, he means the Men in her, is the only communion in the
world, that will endure such insolencies as these</i>; and this, tho it
be somewhat <i>Bonnerish</i> again, and <i>Switcher</i>-like, yet
however seems to <ins class = "correction"
title = "reading uncertain, perhaps 'loer'">leer</ins>
of our side; but then presently in another
place he's as zealous for the <i>Roman</i> Sect, and Jesuitically
condemns a little wholesom Satyr in the Character of a pamper'd
hypocritical covetous <i>Spanish Fryer</i>,
<span class = "sidenote">Collier, p. 98.</span>
for incivility in making him a Pimp to <i>Lorenzo</i>, and is very angry
at the Author for calling this virtuous person <i>a parcel of holy Guts
and Garbidge</i>, and telling him <i>that he has room in his Belly for
his Church-steeple</i>; and here his Lash is up again for abusing
them&mdash;oh&mdash;if <i>Doctor Absolution</i> were Inquisitor general,
and a Satyrist against Priests came under his hand, mercy upon us, how
that poor Rascal would be flaug'd, for I find 'tis only the person of
the Priest that he would have reverenc'd, let his opinion be what it
will; nay, tho he were a <i>Priest of Baal</i>, as may be prov'd a
little further, for here his Zeal shews itself not only for Christians,
but the very <i>Turks</i> too;
<span class = "sidenote">Collier, p. 61.</span>
and cavils again with <i>Jacinta</i>, in the <i>Mock Astrologer</i>, for
jesting with <i>Alla</i>, and honest <i>Mahomet</i>, for he was a
Brother Priest too: But stay, what's worst of all, have but patience to
walk to another Page, and here you will find him just sinking into a
downright doze and despondency, whither he had best set up for any
Religion at all, or at least for one very indifferent.</p>

<p>
<span class = "sidenote">Collier, p. 28.</span>
<i>Our Poets, I suppose, would call this Preaching, and think it a dull
business; however, I can't forbear saying, an honest Heathen is none of

reforming Gentleman is very Luke-warm here, or not a little craz'd when
he writ this, or, as the vulgar have it, was not his mighty Wit run a
Wool-gathering; for if he be for <i>Protestantism</i>, and
<i>Popery</i>, and then whip&mdash;amongst the <i>Bens of the

<p>But now I think I have said enough for the Plays, whose Authors are
much better able to speak for themselves; and therefore will fall off to
vindicate my self a little, and my Acquaintance <i>Don Quixot</i>; in
which I will endeavour to prove another Immoral Vice in our
Stage-Reformer, which is</p>

<h2>Injustice and Error in Criticism.</h2>

<p>And first, his <i>Injustice</i> appears by his ungentlemanlike
exposing me and others by name, upon a scandalous occasion (as he
endeavours to
<span class = "pagenum">17</span>
<span class = "folionum">c</span>
make it) without any Injury done by me to him, or ever giving him any
provocation, or the Play's any way deserving it. Oh, but he'll say his
Conscience urg'd him to do it&mdash;No&mdash;not a jot; 'twas dear
darling Interest, in good faith, as shall hereafter appear; but in the
mean time I am planted upon the shoulders of a Gyant, which is the
Ingenious Author of the History of <i>Don Quixote</i>; and there indeed
he guesses right, tho he knows nothing of him or of his History, as I
will prove by and by, yet confidently, and Absolver-like, he ranges his
objections under three heads, which are every one malicious and false,
<i>viz.</i></p>

<p>First, <i>The Prophaneness, with respect to Religion and the Holy
Scriptures</i>.</p>

<p>Secondly, <i>The Abuse of the Clergy</i>.</p>

<p>Thirdly, <i>The want of Modesty, and Regard to the
Audience</i>.</p>

<p>
Well, to prove the Prophaneness, he first instances a bold Song of mine,
as he calls it, against Providence; four of the last lines of which he
is only pleas'd to shew ye.

<p>
<span class = "sidenote">Collier p. 97.</span>
<i>Here</i>, says he, <i>the Poet tells ye Providence makes Mankind by
halves, huddles up the Soul, and takes the least care of the better
Moyety; this is direct blaspheming the Creation, and a Satyr upon God
Almighty</i>. Why, now this, I confess, is enough to provoke some heat
in a fellow of my Constitution, to hear this Religious Raving; but yet
it looks so like <i>Oliver's Porter's in Bedlam</i>, that I will be
calm, and patiently holding up my hand, plead <i>Not Guilty</i>&mdash;to
all of these objections. But first, pray why does he foyst in the word
Mankind here to express the Female Sex, when t'other word is so much
more proper. I did intend indeed a small Satyr upon <i>Womankind</i>,
pursuant to <i>Marcella</i>'s Character, and he has vary'd from that
word, I suppose, to amuse the Reader&mdash;I'll give ye the whole
Stanza.</p>

</div>

<p>I only rally a pretty coy wench here for her sullen ill nature,
without any Satyr on the Deity, or any thing like it; for as to the
<i>Blasphemy</i>, as he calls it, by naming the word <i>Providence</i>,
'tis generally intended in Lyrical Poetry for <i>Goddess Nature</i>, or
<i>Fortune</i>, as Mr <i>Vanbrooke</i> notes; but never apply'd
seriously to the true Deity, but only by Dr <i>Crambo</i>. How often
have we this phrase in Poetry, <i>Nature has made her Body charming; see
her bright Eyes, the charming gifts of Nature</i>, &amp;c. making use
still of the second cause instead of the first, which we yet know to be
the original of all. And 'tis no more Blasphemy to say that Providence
took more care of a perverse beautiful Womans Body than her Soul, than
'tis to say that the Sun made a gay Tulip flourish in a
Garden
<span class = "pagenum">18</span>
to delight the Eye, not caring three-pence tho it never smelt so sweet
as a Province rose.</p>

<p>But I have a Rigid Critick and a Severe Inquisitor to deal
with&mdash;He will have a Satyr upon the true Deity, tho I intend
nothing of it. And to go on, my next advance he says is to Droll upon
the <i>Resurrection</i>; and to prove it, squirts out these two lines,
which are pick'd out of twenty&mdash;which he thinks are fit for his

comparatively are not fitter for an <i>Anthem</i> than a Droll, but the

to be made and sung by <i>Gines de Passamonte</i>, a most notorious
Atheistical Villain, who, as he is going Chain'd to the Galleys, is
redeem'd from them by <i>Don Quixot</i> in his frantick fit; after
which, being extreamly pleas'd at
<span class = "pagenum">19</span>
<span class = "folionum">c2</span>
the success, he, to make his deliverer merry, entertains him with this
Vindication of a Rogue, which is indeed a Satyr upon Humanity in
general. I will add agen to our Criticks morsel, for he notes but the
four first lines in a place, and give ye one whole Stanza.</p>

<p>And so on: Now tho I grant this might be look'd on as prophane in it
self, without application, yet when spoken by one of his character, whom
I design to expose, it is no more than natural Character, and has so
little the quality of <ins class = "correction" title = "original reads
'Prohaneness'">Prophaneness</ins>, that my impartial Reader will find a
very good Moral in it, by the odious representation of such Atheistical
impudence; yet our good natur'd Critick makes me the Prophaner. He,
cramm'd full of wonderful Justice, makes me the <i>Vice</i> my self,
that only act the true duty of a Poet, and hold up the Glass for others
to see their <i>Vices</i> in, but his Malice will not be Authentick with
every one, no more than his next Addle Criticism, upon my using the word
<i>Redeemer</i> will bear the Test; for he that will argue that that
word may not be innocently spoken in Temporal Matters, because it is
sometimes us'd as a <i>Divine Attribute</i>, will prove himself rather a
Coxcomb than a Casuist: And yet for only this poor word the Cat with
Nine Tails are up again, and the Inquisitor in a rage cries
out,
<span class = "sidenote">Collier, p. 198.</span>
<i>these insolencies are too big for the Correction of a Pen</i>. Very
fine, what horrible correction this deserves, is easily judg'd, and I
believe 'twill be own'd too, that if Doctor Absolution (when the
charitable Prelates good Nature and Purse got him out of his Stone
Apartment yonder, into which <i>his bigotted obstinacy and not his
tender Conscience</i> had thrown him) did not think him his
<i>Redeemer</i>, and thank him as his <i>Redeemer</i>, he does not only
deserve Correction for his wicked ingratitude, (which <i>especially in
one of his Coat, is an immoral Cheat upon Heaven</i>) but to have the
same punishment that another of his Coat and Kidney lately had, for a
Cheat upon the Government and People.</p>

<p>But to go on: In the next place he finds fault with my making sport
with Hell, and recites six Lines, which are made of Dogril Stuff, on
purpose by the Duke's Servants, who, for his diversion, Acting a kind of
Farce are to fright <i>Sancho</i> with Goblings and Furies&mdash;but to
shew his own Wit in the first Onset here, he has notably made the two
first Lines half nonsence.</p>
<span class = "pagenum">20</span>

<div class = "verse2">

<p>Words adapted only to <i>Sancho</i>'s Clownship, course Breeding, and
Kitchin Profession, and with no more intent of Impiety in them, than if
one should put on a Devils Vizard to play with a Child, does he note
again as horrible Prophaneness, and says he does me no wrong in't; now
if he insists that Hell is too serious a thing to ridicule, why,
perhaps, I think so too, in its Intense quality; but to act a Goblin, a
Ghost, a Frog, or a Fury, and to sing to a Country Clown of such Bugbear
matters, only to cause a little Diversion in a Noblemans House, has
always been very customary, especially at Festivals, and far from being
thought to ridicule the main matter. The <i>Absolver</i>, to turn back a
little, affirms indeed, That
<span class = "sidenote">Collier, p. 189.</span>
<i>those that bring Devils upon the <span class = "flag">stage</span>,
can hardly believe them any where else</i>; but I can give an instance,
that our famous <i>Ben Johnson</i>, who I will believe had a Conscience
as good as the Doctors, and who liv'd in as Pious an Age, in his Comedy
call'd the
<span class = "sidenote">Vid. <i>Devil's an Ass</i>, p.
9.</span>
<i>Devil's an Ass</i>, makes his first Scene a Solemn Hell, where
<i>Lucifer</i> sits in State with all his Privy-Council about him: and
when he makes an under Pug there beaten and fool'd by a Clod-pated
Squire and his wanton Wife, the Audience took the Representation
morally, and never keck'd at the matter. Nay, <i>Milton</i>, tho' upon
his secred Subject, comes very near the same thing too; but we must not
laugh at silly <i>Sancho</i>, nor put on a Devils face to fright him,
but we must be disciplin'd; nay, more, Presented for it. Here, tho' I
digress a little, I cannot forbear telling some, that were too busie in
doing that Office, that 'tis more easie to accuse our Writings for
Blasphemous, than to prove them to be so. To detect us indeed fairly,
and prove it upon us, would deserve severe Chastisement; but if it be
mistake, and our reputations are injur'd by Rashness and Injustice, or
Ignorance, reflection upon it is at least reasonable, and just reproof I
think not improper. But to go on; my next fault is the Ass that's
brought upon the Stage in the Epilogue, with two lines alluding to
<i>Balaam</i>'s.</p>

<div class = "verse">
<i>And as 'tis said a Parlous Ass once spoke,</i><br>
<i>When Crab-tree Cudgel did his rage provoke, &amp;c.</i>
</div>

<p>Here he says,
<span class = "sidenote">Collier, p. 199.</span>
<i>I brought the Ass in only to laugh at the Miracle</i>: Not I, truly,
I had no such intention upon my word; I brought the Ass in, and
<i>Dogget</i> upon him, only to make the Audience laugh at his figure at
the end of the Play, as well as they had at the beginning; but I believe
if I had put an <i>Absolver</i> upon his back, giving him a Blessing, it
would have been more divertive by half; but let him alone, the next
horrible Crime is, I meddle with Churchmen, and there
my
<span class = "sidenote">Collier, p. 200.</span>
<i>malice makes me</i>, he says, <i>lay about me like a Knight
Errant</i>; but I believe I shall prove, for all the modesty he pretends
to, that his malice is more in reference to Poets, than ever mine was to
Churchmen. Well, my Second Part begins, he says, with <i>Devil's being
brought upon the Stage</i>, who cries,
<span class = "pagenum">21</span>
<i>As he hopes to be sav'd; and </i>Sancho<i> warrants him a good
Christian.</i> Now this is a ridiculous mistake, for this Devil is only
a Butler, and a Jest of his <i>Giants</i>, the witty Author of the
History of <i>Don Quixot</i>, where one of the Duke's Servants acting a
Devils Part to fright the Knight and Squire, blunders it out before he
is aware, and <i>Sancho</i> hearing it, as foolishly replies. This would
be humorously witty now with any one but our Critick; but he's resolv'd
to see double, as he does presently again with my <i>deep-mouth'd
swearing</i> which he says is frequent, tho he has quoted none on't, and
therefore the Reader is not oblig'd to believe him. But then I have made
the <i>Curate </i><ins class = "correction"
title = "unclear: character's name is Pero Perez">Perez</ins><i>
assist at the ridiculous
Ceremony of </i>Don Quixot<i>;</i> I have so&mdash;what then?&mdash;but
I have made him <i>have wit enough</i>, however, to know <i>Don
Quixot</i> for a Madman; but then <i>Sancho</i>, by way of Proverb,
tells him, <i>Ah&mdash;Consider dear Sir, no Man is born wise</i>: to
which briskly replies the Doctor,
<span class = "sidenote">Collier, Ibid.</span>
<i>What if he were born wise, he might be bred a Fool</i>. Faith, no
Doctor: and to be free with ye, (<i>en Raillere</i>) as you have been
with me, must beg leave to tell ye, If you had been born wise enough to
be a Reformer, your Breeding could never have made ye Fool enough to be
an Absolver; I mean in a Case like you know what; but let us proceed.
The next is a swinger, and his Lash cuts even to the blood: for here
<i>Sancho</i>, full of innocent simplicity, says, <i>A Bishop is no more
than another Man, without Grace and good Breeding</i>. To which he
presently darts out,
<span class = "sidenote">Ibid.</span>
<i>I must needs say, if the Poet had any share of either of these
Qualities, he would be less bold with his Superiors, and not give his
Clowns the liberty to Droll thus heavily upon a solemn Character</i>.
Why, faith, now this is very hard, I have known a Country Wench name a
<i>Bishop</i> in the Burning-too of a Hasty-Pudding, and never heard
that any of the Reverend took it ill, because it was a Common Saying,
and below their notice. But poor <i>Sancbo</i>, or rather indeed
<i>Sancho</i>'s Poet, my self, must be corrected for it, tho the Phrase
be Moral, and no more than an honest truth: But come, since it must be
so, let me ask the <span class = "flag">doctor</span> why he does not
shew me an example for this himself, and <span class =
"flag">Practice</span> better before he Accuses; for let the Reader look
into his <i>Desertion Discuss'd</i> (for he shall find that I have
trac'd him through all his <span class = "flag">Writings) and</span>
page the 3d you will find him, I think, somewhat more guilty of this
fault than I have been, for there you'll
<span class = "picture">
<a href = "images/pg21upper.png"><img src = "images/pg21upper.png" width
= "425" height = "76" alt = "page image"></a>
</span>
see he insolently affirms,
<span class = "sidenote"><i>Desertion Discuss'd</i>, Anno
1688.</span>
<i>That the Succession cannot be interrupted by an Act of Parliament,
especially when the Royal Assent is given by a King </i>de Facto<i>, and
not </i>de Jure<i>.</i> And again; tho this next is hinted covertly,
with the meaning disguis'd, yet Sir <i>William Temple</i> in his
Memoirs, page 295, and the aforesaid Vindicater of the Stage, as well as
my self, have observed, that the <span class = "flag"><i>Absolver</i></span>
in the first Volume of his Essays, page 120, in his Chapter of the
<i><ins class = "correction" title =
"word unreadable">A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</ins></i> tells us,
<span class = "sidenote"><i>Essays</i>, p.120.</span>
<i>Whether the honesty or dishonesty are discernable in the face, <span
class = "flag">is a question</span> which admits of dispute; King
</i>Charles<i> the Second thought he could depend upon these
Observations, but with submission, I believe an <span class =
"flag">instance</span> might be given, in which his Rules of Physiognomy
fail'd.</i>
<span class = "picture">
<a href = "images/pg21lower.png"><img src = "images/pg21lower.png" width

</span>
Now I'm sure the first is insolently plain, and the next shews enough to
let us into his meaning; which granted, I think I may say, he ought to
be less bold with his Superiors too, and not give himself the liberty to
treat at this rate, not only a Solemn, but a <i>Royal Character</i>.
Well, the next is, I, (naming me) take care to tell ye,
that
<span class = "pagenum">22</span>
<i>Sancho</i> is <i>a dry shrewd Countryfellow</i> in his Character,
<i>because he blunders out Proverbs upon all occasions, tho never so far
from the purpose</i>&mdash;and merrily drolls upon me for making
blundering and talking nothing to the purpose, an argument of
shrewdness&mdash;Why truly, I must confess to the Doctor, there is no
great matter in that Argument, and not much whither there be or
no&mdash;But, as unperforming as I am, I fancy I shall find as great a
Blunder in his performance presently&mdash;
<span class = "sidenote">Essays p. 118.</span>
<i>We ought to be just in our Looks, as well as in our Actions</i>, says
he in his Essays, <i>for the mind may be declar'd one way no less than
the other: A man might as good break his Word as his Face, especially
upon some Critical occasions</i>. Now what he means by a mans breaking
his Face there, unless he is to run his Nose against a Post, I can't
imagine; and therefore will set it down for a Blunder&mdash;And so
there's Tit for Tat, and the Dice in my hand still. But poor
<i>Sancho</i> is horribly unfortunate agen, for by and by he catches him
answering the Curate, who threatens him for calling him Finisher of
Fornication, and Conjunction Copulative, with Excommunication,
<span class = "sidenote">Collier, p. 201.</span>
<i>I care not if you do, says Sancho, I shall lose nothing by it but my
Nap in an afternoon</i>. Why truly this might be thought a little sawcy
from one in Trowsers, to one in a Cassock, especially as the Reformer
would have him reverenc'd. But perhaps this Pragmatical Curate
<i>Perez</i> was some <i>Non-Juror</i>, and poor <i>Sancho</i> did not
think he should profit by his Doctrine; and then the honest fellow was
much in the right. This puts me in mind of a passage in one of Mr
<i>Crown</i>'s Comedies, where a surly Joyner is rallying with a Doctor
of no very good Reputation too; <i>Sirrah, Sirrah, says the Doctor, I
shall have your Ears&mdash;No, No, says </i>Chizzel<i>, never when you
preach, Doctor</i>. Our Absolver may apply this now as he
pleases.</p>

<p>And here are a bundle of faults together&mdash;<i>Jodolet</i>,
another Priest, is call'd
<span class = "sidenote">Ibid.</span>
holy Cormorant, only because he eats a Turkey, and drinks a Bottle or
two of Malaga for his Breakfast; and the Poet is jerk'd because a
gormandizing <i>Romish</i> Priest is call'd a Pimp agen; and the Duke's
Steward, <i>Manuel</i>, is no <i>witty pleasant fellow</i>, because he
calls the Chaplain, whom I mentioned in the beginning of my Preface, and
who is, no doubt, the sole occasion of this Gentleman's Pique to
me&mdash;Mr <i>Cuff-cushion</i>; and because having an insight into his
Character, he tells him,
<span class = "sidenote">Ibid.</span>
<i>a Whore is a Pulpit be loves</i>; but my hope is, that my Reader will
think him no fool for this, tho the Carper does, who then tells the
Chaplain <i>Saygrace</i>, <i>and he supposes prays to God to bless the
entertainment of the Devil</i>, tho there is not a word of a Grace spoke
at all; and after, when he grows hot, positive, and impertinent, which
the Duke his patron being at Table, only bears with, to divert himself,
he insolently calls <i>Don Quixot</i>, Don Coxcomb, who justly enrag'd,
returns him in this Language:
<span class = "sidenote">Collier, p. 202.</span>
<i>Oh thou vile black Fox, with a Firebrand in thy Tail, thou very
priest, thou kindler of all Mischiefs in all Nations, de'e hear, Homily,
did not the reverence I bear these Nobles&mdash;I would so thrum your
Cassock, you Church Vermin</i>&mdash;Here now, to shew his Justice he
slily stops and gives a dash, so makes it Nonsense, but I shall make
bold to piece it out again. <i>Did not the reverence I bear these
Nobles, tye up my hands from doing myself Justice, I would so thrum your
Cassock you Church Vermin</i>&mdash;Now, because my Reader shall find
that I have naturally pursu'd
<span class = "pagenum">23</span>
the character of this Chaplain, as <i>Don Quixot</i>'s Historian has
presented him to me, you shall hear what account he gives of him. Here
is, says he,
<span class = "sidenote">Shelton's <i>Translation of the History of
</i>D. Quix.<i> Chap.</i> 31. p. 152.</span>
<i>a good Character of a poor Pedant; one of them that govern great
men's Houses, one of those, that as they are not born Noble, so they
know not how to instruct those that are; one of those, that would have
great men's Liberality measur'd by the streightness of their own Minds;
one of those, that teaching those they govern to be frugal, would make
'em miserable.</i> Now this considerable person as you find him here,
who was indeed for his senseless humour of designing to
govern&mdash;us'd no otherwise than as the Buffoon of the
Family&mdash;takes upon him to call <i>Don Quixot</i> (whom the Authour
imbellishes, with all manner of learning and good sense, bating his
whimsical Chimæra of Knight Errantry,) <i>Goodman Dulpate</i> and <i>Don
Coxcomb</i>. Well, however the <i>Switcher</i> here has escap'd for his
usage of a <ins class = "correction"
title = "original reads 'Gentlemen'">Gentleman</ins>
in or near this manner, I believe my Judges
will agree, that my Knight was so far from injuring the sawcy
Trencherfly, by the reply he give him, that if he had not known and
practic'd good breeding, better than the other, he would have broke his
head into the bargain. As for his bidding him adieu in Language too
prophane and scandalous for our Reformer to relate, is impossible, for
he has prov'd often enough the contrary of that in his Book already. But
for the Song in the Fourth Act, where the Country Fellow says, <i>Folks
never mind now what those black Cattle say</i>:
<span class = "sidenote">Ibid.</span>
He is only suppos'd for another Bumpkin, that amongst the rest of the
Parishioners, had found out the Parsons blind side, and so behind his
back took occasion to put a joke upon him, as well as the rest in that
Satyr mention'd.</p>

<p>And now his third place is to prove my want of Modesty, and regard to
the Audience&mdash;And here he's chewing his savoury word <i>Smutt</i>
agen, and says
<span class = "sidenote">Collier, p. 203.</span>
<i>Sancho</i> and <i>Teresa</i> talk it broad; but since his Modesty has
not quoted it, I hope my Reader will believe so well of mine, to think I
have not written it; I assure him I don't know of any. And I have prov'd
our Reformer can mistake, as he does of <i>Marcellas</i> Epilogue, who
Raves, he says, with Raptures of Indecency, when the poor Creature is so
cold, after her hot fit, that she rather wants a dram of the
Bottle&mdash;But now, Bounce, for a full charge of Small Shot; here he
has gather'd up a heap of Epithets together, without any words between,
or connexion to make 'em sense; and this he says I divert the Ladies
with&mdash;<i>Snotty nose, filthy vermin in the Beard, Nitty Jerkin, and
Louse snapper, with the Letter in the Chamber-pot, and natural
evacuation</i>. Why truly this is pretty stuff indeed, as his Ingenuity
has put it together&mdash;but I hope every one will own, that each of
these singly, when they are tagg'd to their sensible phrases, may be
proper enough in Farce or Low Comedy; but as he has modell'd 'em, 'tis
true they are very frightful&mdash;And if I had nothing to sing or say
to divert Ladies better than this, I should think my self so despicable,
that I would e'en get into the next Plot, amongst his Brother
Grumblers&mdash;then despairing, do some doughty thing to deserve
hanging, and depend upon no other comfort but his Absolution.</p>

<p>I remember, being lately at St. <i>James</i>'s, this very part of the
Doctors Book was read or rather spelt out to me, with tickling
satisfaction, by one whose Wit and good Manners are known to be just of
the same
<span class = "pagenum">24</span>
weight, who, since he can be merry so easily, he shall laugh at some of
the Reformers Hotch-potch too, as I have mingled it for
him.
<span class = "sidenote">Collier's Epithetes.<br>
<br>

<i>Jewish Tetragramaton, Stigian Frogs, reeking Pandæmoniums, Debauch'd
Protagonists, Nauseous Ribaldry, Ranting Smutt, Abominable Stench</i>,
Venus <i>and St </i>George Juliana<i>, the Witch and the Parson of
</i>Wrotham,
<i>with the admirable Popish story of the Woman that went to the
Play-House and brought home the Devil with her</i>&mdash;And the Devil's
in't indeed, if this charming Rhetorick of his, (since he calls mine so)
especially joyn'd with that fine story from <i>Tertullian</i>, don't
divert the Ladies as well as t'other; for 'tis very like a Catholick
miracle you must know, and the top wit of it is, that when the Parson is
Conjuring, <i>he asks the Devil how he durst attack a Christian?</i>
who, like an admirable Joker as he was, answers, <i>I have done nothing
but what I can justify, for I seiz'd her upon my own ground</i>. Now let
the Devil be as witty as he can, I am sure the story, maugre
<i>Tertullian</i>'s Authority, or the Doctor's either, is confounded
silly, and downright nonsense, what credit soever it has with him for
its likeness to Jesuiticism. And now I think I have prov'd too, that
<i>a Clergy man can speak nonsense, pass it for humour too, and gratify
his ease and his malice at once, without a Poet's putting his into his
Mouth</i>. And since we have been speaking of quibbling, I shall digress
a little to entertain the Reader on that subject. Our Critick rallies Mr
<i>Dryden</i>'s <i>Sancho</i> in <i>Love Triumphant</i>, for saying,
<i>dont provoke me, I'm mischievously bent</i>, to which <i>Carlos</i> a
man of sense replys,
<span class = "sidenote">Collier, p. 170.</span>
<i>nay you are bent enough in conscience, but I have a bent Fist for
Boxing; Here</i> says he (smartly) <i>you have a brace of quibbles
started in a line and a half</i>&mdash;Very true, you have so&mdash;But
suppose quibbling or punning&mdash;but I think this is call'd
punning&mdash;Is this Gentlemans humour&mdash;if so, being a Soldier, I
don't see it calls his sense in question at all&mdash;but now pray let's
see, how our Critick manages a quibble, with a blunder tack'd to the
Tail on't, in the page before, there, in the aforesaid Play,
<i>Celidea</i> in a passion cries,</p>

<div class = "verse">

<i>Great Nature break thy Chain that links together<br>

</div>

<p><i>Now</i>, says the Doctor, keen as a Razor, <i>if she had call'd
for a Chair, instead of a Chaos, tripp'd off, and kept her folly to
herself, the woman had been wiser.</i> Calling for a Chair instead of a
Chaos is an extreme pretty Quibble truly&mdash;but if the Critick had
let the Chair-men have tripp'd off with her, instead of doing it herself
as she sat in a <ins class = "correction"

I'm sure the blunder had been sav'd, and I think
he had exprest himself a little wiser than he has&mdash;And come, now my
hand's in, let's parallel Mr <i>Dryden</i> with our Reformer a little
longer&mdash;<i>Church-men</i> (says <i>Benducar</i> in <i>Don

<i>These Lines</i>, says he, <i>are an Illustration taken from a

whose own flights are ten times more ridiculous: For example, talking
just before of tumbling the Elements together, he says,
<span class = "sidenote">Collier, p. 158.</span>
<i>and since we have shewn our skill of Vaulting on the High Ropes, a

will refer my self to the severest Critick of his party, whether an

way of Writing he thinks will <ins class = "correction" title =

with me I assure him, to confirm it I must remark him once more, and
then my digression shall end. He tells ye <i>Cleora</i>, in the Tragedy

deny it, she is so far from swearing fast, that she does not (rude as
her character is) swear at all, unless the poor interjection

peruse him on, here
<span class = "pagenum">26</span>
is a whole page and half upon this hint,
<span class = "sidenote">Collier, p. 204.</span>
That the Ladies must have left their Wits and Modesties behind them that
came, and lik'd her Words or Actions; and that her Nastiness, and dirty
Conversation, is a Midnight Cart, or a Dunghil, instead of an Ornamental
Scene. Now you don't find out our Gentlemans malicious meaning by this,
but I shall inform ye. He says, I'm sorry the Ladies brought their Wits
and Modesties with them, that came to see this Character; and yet all
the whole Town can witness, that as many of the Ladies as could get into
the Play-House came thither, to wait upon Her late <i>Majesty of Sacred
Memory</i>, who did me that honour only for my benefit; and who was of
so nice a Temper, relating to Modesty, that if so much as a hint had
been given her by those had seen it before, of such a thing as
Immodesty, she had never came, much less had been diverted, as she was,
when she did come; but this I take as striking at <i>her</i> through my
sides; and I think, to use his own words,
<span class = "sidenote">Collier, p. 206.</span>
<i>is above the Correction of the Pen</i>. The next is such senseless
malice, or ignorance, that it deserves a hoot; he finds <i>Manuel</i> in
<i>Don Quixot</i> (playing in his Farce for the Dukes diversion)
addressing to the Dutchess in this manner, in a Jargon of Phrase made
ridiculous on purpose:
<span class = "sidenote">Vid. Shelton's <i>Translation of </i>Don
Quixot<i>, p.</i> 205.</span>
<i>Illustrious beauty, I must desire to know whether the most
purifidiferous </i>Don Quixot<i> of the </i>Manchissima<i>, and the
Squireiferous </i>Pancha<i>, be in this Company or no</i>. To whom
<i>Sancho</i> replies, imitating, as he thinks this fine stile, <i>Why
lookee, forsooth, without any more flourishes, the Governor
</i>Pancha<i> is here, and </i>Don Quixotissimo<i> too, therefore, most
Afflictedissimous Matronissima, speak what you Willissimus, for we are
all ready to be your Servitorissimus</i>. And this now he inserts as my
own Invention and manner of Stile, which is taken <i>verbatim</i> from
the History of <i>Don Quixot</i>, and is by all those that can judge of
humour, very pleasant and fit for that purpose. Now if he has never read
that History, his ignorance has abus'd me; and if he has, his impudence
has, of which us perceiv'd he has Stock enough, for presently he worries
me for saying, in my Epistle Dedicatory to the Duchess of <i>Ormond</i>,
That
<span class = "sidenote">Collier, p. 207.</span>
<i>I date my good fortune from her prosperous influence</i>, and says
'tis <i>Astrological</i>. I don't know whether it has that sort of
Learning in't or no, but 'tis as good sense as when he says, like a Wag
as he is, that the Ladies fancy is just
<span class = "sidenote">Collier, p. 92.</span>
<i>slip-stocking high, and she seems to want sense more than her
Break-fast</i>. Fancy slip-stocking high? no, no, the merry Grig must
mean her pretty Leg was seen so high, for the Master of Art, I beg
pardon of the rest that their Title is scandaliz'd, could never mean
such Nonsence as t'other sure.</p>

<p>And now drawing near to an end, his malice grows more plainly to a
head, by endeavouring to lessen my Credit with my Patron Mr.
<i>Montague</i>, whose generous Candor and good Nature to me, and indeed
to us all, he perhaps has heard of, for here our modest and moral
Critick, has either mistaken the words, or found out a slip of the
Press, which because it happens to be Nonsence, he has very gladly
exposed for mine; 'tis in my Epistle to my aforesaid Patron,
thus:
<span class = "sidenote">Collier, p. 207.</span>
<i>Had your Eyes shot the haughty Austerity upon me of a right Courtier,
your valued minutes had never been disturbed with dilatory Trifles of
this nature; but my heart, on dull Consideration of your Merit, had
supinely wish'd you Prosperity at a distance</i>. Mine in my Copy was
written [<i>due Consideration</i>] but Doctor Crambo will have you
believe, I consider'd so little to write the t'other;
but
<span class = "pagenum">27</span>
<span class = "folionum">d2</span>
now I will hold twenty Stubble Geese to the same number of Tithe Pigs,
whenever he is preferr'd to be a Curate again, that I make my Patron
smile more at my Entertainment of him at his own Cost, than ever he did
at his quoting my <i>dull Consideration</i>, which no body but the
<i>dull Absolver</i> could imagine a Man with any Brains could write.
And to prove I have yet a few, I will try to Paraphrase upon his Farewel
to me, the Translation in Verse, but the Reader shall have his
first.</p>

<h1>THE PREFACE</h1>

<p><i>The Charge drawn up by </i>Mr. Collier<i>,
against the English Stage hath obliged
the Persons concerned in it, to use all
possible methods for their own Vindication. But
their Endeavours of this kind have been such as
seem to have done no great Service to their Cause.
The natural Reflection, arising upon the present
State of the Controversy, is, that, when Persons so
nearly concerned and so well qualified, to say all that
the case will bear, have yet been able to say so little
to the main points of the Accusation brought against
them, the only effectual Reply would be either to
write no more for the Stage, or to write for it after
quite another manner, than of late hath been done.
They that have attempted to answer the </i>View<i> are in
good hands already. But since other Succours are
called in from abroad, 'tis fit the World should
know, that this Reserve too hath been already defeated
in it's own Countrey. And that we ought not
to be imposed upon here in England, with an Adversary,</i>
<span class = "pagenum">|</span>
<i>whose Arguments have been not only confuted
and Scorned by Others, but also retracted by Himself, at home.</i></p>

<p><i>That Moroseness of humour, which Some in great
good manners have of late been pleased to fix upon
the English as their peculiar Character, might
<ins class = "correction" title =
"original reads 'possiby'">possibly</ins>
be thought to dispose us to a blameable Extreme
of Rigor in these matters. And therefore a Forreign
Authority was artificially enough brought in, to
reproach our pretended Niceness and Austerity.
But when the Arguments of this Reply are observed
to carry the Point as high, as even the so much
upbraided </i>View<i> it self; All but the Willfully blind
must see, that even the Gayeties of France could not
endure the Corruptions of the Modern Theatres.
And that the Complaints against such detestable
Abuses are not due to any Quality of the Climate,
or particular turn of Temper; but to the common
and uniform Principles of Christianity and Virtue,
which are the same in every Nation, professing to be
governed by them.</i></p>

<p><i>To give that </i>Discourse<i> a better face, it is introduced
by way of Letter from a </i>Worthy Divine<i>
of the Church of England; and published
before a late Play called </i>Beauty in Distress.
<span class = "sidenote"><i>P. IX. X. XXVI.</i></span>
<i>Tis said to be approved, and recommended by that Reverend
Person, for the satisfying some Scruples,
</i>whether a man may Lawfully write for the
Stage<i>. For a full Resolution whereof the doubting
Poet is referred to this </i>Discourse<i>, as that which
is presumed </i>to come fully up to his purpose<i>.
But we are not told, whether the </i>Divine<i> or the </i>Poet<i>,
or who else was the Translator of this Discourse: Or
whether that </i>Worthy<i> Friend perused it in French,
or in English only. Which yet in the present Case</i>
<span class = "pagenum">|</span>
<span class = "folionum">A3</span>
<i>are Material Circumstances, and such as ought not
to have been concealed, for Two Reasons particularly,
which I hold myself obliged to give the Reader
Intimation of.</i></p>

<p><i>The First is, That the following Reply produces
and answers some Passages of the French Discourse,
not to be found in the English. And these not only
Expressions or single Sentences, but entire Arguments.
Such is that of Plays being a Diversion
suitable to the Design of instituting the Sabbath.
Such again That which justifies the Acting them
the whole Lent throughout. Now this manner of
dealing is not exactly agreeable with that</i>
<span class = "sidenote"><i>P. IX.</i></span>
Impartiality<i> and </i>Freedom<i> promised
in the beginning of the </i>Worthy Divines<i> Letter.
And therefore I can
very hardly be perswaded, that One of that Character
and Function, had the Forming of the </i>Discourse<i>,
in the manner it now appears before </i>Mr. M's.<i>
Play.</i></p>

<p><i>The other Reason, why I Suspect the </i>Discourse<i>
not to be translated, or indeed so throughly approved,
by a </i>Divine of the Church of England<i>, is,
that, even in what does appear there, he speaks very
favourably of acting Plays upon Sundays. Now
admitting, that all the Profession are not such
sowr Criticks as </i>Mr. Collier<i>, yet this is a Liberty,
which I do not remember to have heard, that any
Modern Divines of that Church allow. And
whatever the Poet's Friend may be in </i>His<i>
esteem, I shrewdly suspect, that He would hardly
pass for a very </i>Worthy Divine<i>, who should so far
Countenance these </i>Diversions<i>, as to let them into
a share of that Holy day, dedicated to the Worship
and more immediate Service of Almighty
God,</i></p>

<span class = "pagenum">|</span>
<p><i>One would not hastily question Testimonies
in matters of Fact, where there appears any probable
Arguments to support them. And therefore
I am far from objecting against the Knowledge and
Integrity of the Booksellers called in to vouch for
that Letter, But withall I must beg leave to
think it strange, that a Person of Learning and
Character should so incautiously espouse a </i>Discourse<i>,
and recommend it for the direction of a Gentleman's
Conscience, who consulted him for Advice; the Reasoning
whereof is not only so weak and Superficiall,
but grounded upon Misconstruction in some, and
Misrepresentation in Other Authorities cited by it.
Methinks these ought to have been well examined,
before a man had so perfectly gone into the Consequences
drawn from them: such of them at least as
are exceeding obvious, and might have been detected
by recurring to Books, which almost every
Divine hath ready at hand.</i></p>

<p><i>In this translated Reply the Reader will not have
cause to complain of such Neglect. The Passages
out of </i>Thom: Aquinas, St. Jerom<i>, and some
others, have been diligently compared, and the Originals
faithfully inserted in most material points.
And I cannot but wish, that this Book, extant at
Paris ever since </i>1694<i>, had fallen into the hands
of this Doubting Gentleman, instead of that </i>Discourse<i>,
which it was intended to confute: That neither
the Translator, nor his Friend the </i>Worthy
Divine<i>, might have given themselves the Trouble
of a Vindication of Plays; so reproachfully treated,
and so substantially answered, that one would wonder
it should have the confidence to appear in English afterwards,
to tempt the same Scorn here, when followed
cross the Seas by the Bishop of Meaux.</i></p>

<span class = "pagenum">|</span>
<span class = "folionum">A4</span>
<p><i>By some expressions, I confess one might
be apt to think, that the Author of the Discourse
was not perfectly known. But of that no
reasonable Doubt can remain, when we find
the Replyer to have retracted: and Submitted
to the Censure of the Church, Why the Author
expresses himself in Terms so soft and general
I undertake not to determine. He
might in Tenderness forbear his Adversarys
Name; He might be content to look upon him
as an unwary Publisher, rather than the
Writer; and, after Submission made, might
charitably desire, as far as might be, to cover
his Reproach. It Suffices, that the Opinions
in the Book be confuted, and exposed to shame;
and when this is done in the Punishment of
the Reputed Author, the matter is not great, if
the Name from thenceforth be forgotten. If
Mons'r </i>Caffaro<i> had the Hardiness to assert
a Tract so unworthy his Character, his Answerer
would not add perhaps to the Scandall,
when that Shame had been taken to himself,
with a Remorse becoming the Fact. But be
this how it will, Censures, we know, are not inflicted
upon </i>Indefinite Some-bodies<i>; that
such were inflicted, and a Retractation made,
the very first period is peremptory: And I
hope the Bp. of Meaux, and his manner of
writing, are at least as credible an Evidence
of this, as the Booksellers can be Allowed to</i>
<span class = "pagenum">|</span>
<i>be, of that Letter being genuine, which refers
</i>Mr. M's<i> Conscience to the </i>Discourse<i> for
Satisfaction.</i></p>

<p><i>I am heartily glad, if the Plays written by
that ingenious Gentleman are so chast and
inoffensive, as he declares them to be. The
rather, because the Success he mentions overthrows
that frivolous Pretence, of the Poets
lying under a Necessity of writing lewdly in
order to please the Town. And if this Gentleman
do yet retain the same tenderness of
doing nothing for Gain or Glory, which does
not strictly become him: If he be still as
desirous to be satisfied what does, or does not,
become him to do, with regard to the matter in
hand, as I ought to presume he was, when he
consulted his Friend, I would make it my
request, that this Reply may be Seriously and
impartially considered. And I cannot but
hope, that it may disabuse him of the Errours
the </i>Discourse<i> might lead him into, and I am
much mistaken, if, upon these Terms, he ever
writes for the Stage any more. Prejudice and
Passion, Vainglory and Profit, not Reason,
and Virtue, and the Common Good, seem but
too plainly, to support this Practice, and the
Defence of it, as the matter is at present
managed among us. And a Person of </i>Mr. M's<i>
Parts and Attainments cannot be at a loss, for
much nobler subjects to employ them upon.</i></p>

<span class = "pagenum">|</span>
<p><i>A Popular one perhaps it may be, but
sure a wilder Suggestion, never was offered to
men of Common sense, than, that </i>if the Stage
be damned<i>, the </i>Art used<i> by </i>Moses, and
David, and Solomon, must be no more.
<span class = "sidenote"><i>See Mr. D's. verses before Beauty,
in Distress.</i></span>
<i>Are we fallen into an Age so incapable of of
distinguishing, that there should be no visible
difference left between, the Excellencies and the
Abuse of any Art? No. </i>Mr: Dryden<i> himself
hath taught us better. We will have all
due regard for the Author of </i>Absalom<i> and
</i>Achitophel<i>, and several other pieces of just
renown, and should admire him for a rich Vein of
Poetry, though he had never written a Play
in his whole Life. Nor shall we think our selves
obliged to burn the Translation of </i>Virgil<i> by
vertue of that sentence, which seems here to be
pronounced upon that of the Fourth Book of
</i>Lucretius<i>. The World, I Suppose, are not
all agreed, that then is but </i>One<i> Sort of Poetry,
and as far from allowing, that the </i>Dramatick<i>, is
that One. They who write after those</i> Divine,
Patterns of Moses &amp;c<i>: will be no whit the less
Poets, though there were not a Theatre left
upon the Face of the Earth; Their Honours
will be more deserved, Their Laurells more verdant
and lasting, when blemished with none of
those Reproaches from Others, or their own
breasts, which are due to the Corrupters of
Mankind, And such are all They, who soften</i>
<span class = "pagenum">|</span>
<i>men's abhorrence of Vice, and cherish their
dangerous Passions. To tell us then, that All,
even Divine, Poetry must be silenced and
for ever lost, when the Play-houses are once
shut up, is to impose too grossely upon our
Understandings. And their Sophistry bears
hard, methinks, upon Profaneness, which insinuates
the Hymns dictated by the Holy Spirit,
of God, to be so nearly related to the Modern
Compositions for the Stage, that both must of
necessity stand and fall together.</i></p>

<p><i>If Poetry have of late sunk in its credit,
that misfortune is owing to the degenerate and
Mercenary Pens, of some who have set up for
the great Masters of it. No man I presume,
is for exterminating that noble Art, no not
even in the </i>Dramatick<i> part; provided it can
be effectually reformed. But if the Reformation
of the Stage be no longer practicable, reason
good that the incurable Evil should be cut
off: If it be practicable, let the Persons concerned
give Evidence of it to the World, by
tempering their Wit so, as to render it Serviceable
to Virtuous purposes, without giving
just offence to wise, and Good men. For
it is not the Pretence of a good Design which
can free the Undertakers from Blame, unless
the Goodness of the end and Intention be Seconded
with a Prudent Management of the
Means. And if Matters once should come to</i>
<span class = "pagenum">|</span>
<i>that Extremity, better and much more becoming
of the Two, no doubt it were, that our
</i>Maker's Praises should be sunk into Prose<i>
(as this Ingenious Person phrases it) than that
in the midst of a Christan City, that </i>Maker<i>
should be six days in seven publickly insulted
and blasphemed in poetry.</i></p>

ENGLISH LITERATURE OF THE<br>

<div class = "indent">Students, scholars, and bibliographers
of literature, history, and
philology will find the publications valuable. <i>The Johnsonian News
Letter</i> has said of them: "Excellent facsimiles, and cheap in
price, these represent the triumph of modern scientific reproduction.
Be sure to become a subscriber; and take it upon yourself to see that
your college library is on the mailing list."</div>

<div class = "indent">The Augustan Reprint Society is a
non-profit, scholarly
organization, run without overhead expense. By careful management it
is able to offer at least six publications each year at the unusually
low membership fee of $2.50 per year in the United States and Canada,
and $2.75 in Great Britain and the continent.</div>

<div class = "indent">Libraries as well as individuals are
eligible for membership. Since
the publications are issued without profit, however, no discount can
be allowed to libraries, agents, or booksellers.</div>

<div class = "indent">New members may still obtain a complete
run of the first year's
publications for $2.50, the annual membership fee.</div>

<div class = "indent">During the first two years the publications
are issued in three
series: I. Essays on Wit; II. Essays on Poetry and Language; and III.
Essays on the Stage.</div>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
